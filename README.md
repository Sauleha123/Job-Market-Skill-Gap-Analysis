## 🛠️ Project Workflow

### 🔹 Python (Data Cleaning & Preparation)

* Cleaned and preprocessed raw job market data
* Standardized skill categories and experience levels
* Prepared datasets for analysis and visualization

### 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyzed job postings by:

  * Industry
  * Location
  * Experience level
  * Skill requirements
* Identified patterns and distributions used for dashboard insights

### 🔹 Power BI (Dashboard & Storytelling)

* Designed a **5-page interactive Power BI dashboard**:

  1. **Job Market Overview**
  2. **Skill Demand Analysis**
  3. **Skill Gap Analysis**
  4. **Salary Insights**
  5. **Insights & Recommendations**
* Added slicers for:

  * Location
  * Experience Level
* Focused on **clear KPIs, comparisons, and business insights**

## 📈 Key Insights

* **IT Services and Staffing industries** dominate Data Analyst hiring.
* **Over 84% of job postings target Entry-level candidates**, indicating strong opportunities for freshers.
* **Programming and Soft Skills together account for over 60%** of total skill demand.
* Significant **skill gaps exist between Entry and Senior roles**, especially in:

  * Programming
  * BI Tools
* Senior roles offer **higher average salaries**, though many job titles share similar salary bands, suggesting standardized compensation structures.
* Only **~4% of roles offer Easy Apply**, increasing competition and application effort.

## 💡 Recommendations for Aspiring Data Analysts

* Focus on **Programming (Python, SQL)** and **BI tools (Power BI / Tableau)** to reduce skill gaps.
* Strengthen **Soft Skills** to meet non-technical hiring expectations.
* Target **Entry-level roles in IT Services and Staffing sectors** for higher job availability.
* Apply broadly and strategically, as Easy Apply roles are limited.
